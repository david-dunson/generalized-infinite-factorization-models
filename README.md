Bayesian inference of Generalized Infinite Factorization models with Structured Increasing Shrinkage prior

The repository includes R functions to perform Bayesian inference under the Structured Increasing Shrinkage model presented in the following paper:
Schiavon, L., Canale, A., Dunson, D.B. (in press) Generalized infinite factorization models, Biometrika.

In particular, the Gibbs sampler allows for Gaussian distributed and possibly missing data.
